# Scientific Visualization project files

## Current contents
- Skeleton code

## Building/Making
For first build, run the following: (Ubuntu/Debian only)
```
./install.sh
```
You may have to run this with `sudo` because the script will attempt to install GLUT and GLEW

After the first build, remake any changes to the code by invoking the make file directly.

## To-Do
- [ ] Transform code to C++
- [ ] Model View Controller structure
- [ ] Switch to QT for UI and rendering
